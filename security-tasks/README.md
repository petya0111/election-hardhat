# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
deployed on goerli 0x3ba399eCa9CdAe82675CAEa7bb422d5659ea7fe3
```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy-testnets --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/interact-goerli.js
```
